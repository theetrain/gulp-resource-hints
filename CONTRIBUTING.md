# Contributing to gulp-resource-hints

Glad to meet you! All feedback and pull requests are welcome. If something isn't working right for you, please [create an issue](#submitting-an-issue).

## Submitting an Issue

Before submitting, search the repository to see if your issue has already been logged, and go give it a :+1:. Submit a new issue an existing one does not match yours.

## Commits

I will not enforce any particular format, though I highly recommend [Niji Commit Format](https://github.com/niji-commit/spec). 

## Pull Requests

I strongly recommend engaging in an existing issue or creating a new one before working on a pull request. That way, the community and I can keep track of what you're working on to avoid any conflicts. This may also help in the event that your pull request may not work well within the scope of this plugin, and you'll know ahead of time not to work on anything unecessary.
